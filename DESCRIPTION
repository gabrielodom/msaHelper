Description: Given that we have .fasta files or IUPred2A .results files, we
  would like to wrangle them into simpler-to-use .csv files. Additionally, we
  also want to make some pretty pictures with that data. This is a small package
  that contains functions to help us work with those files. NOTE: while we 
  recommend the use of the Tidyverse syntax of R (see http://tidyverse.org), we
  avoid depending on these functions when writing our package. The vignettes,
  however, make liberal use of the Tidyverse functions.
